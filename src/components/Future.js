        As I have not gained experience in IT-companies,<br/> it would be
        awesome to get into a trainee program or land a job during my studies. <br />In the
        future I see myself working in software development, machine learning and cyber security related fields.<br/> Entrepreunership would also be one of my point of
        interests.
