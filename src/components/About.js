      <p>
        My name is Joonas Uusnäkki. I am 22-year-old student from Espoo.
        Currently I am studying information systems and economics at University
        of Jyväskylä. My studies consists heavily of computer science and
        economics, two subjects that I hope I can combine at future work.
        Freetime-activities such as producing music, taking aesthetic photos and
        creating video content are the most rewarding ones for me personally.
        In the future I would like to get better at these things and at the same
        time learn more about my field of study, such as AI, Internet Of Things
        and large variety of programming languages.
